<!-- PROJECT PLANNING AND USER STORIES -->
## Project Planning and User Stories

Using Excalidraw and AdobeXD, I created a wireframe and data archatecture plan. The MVP was to create an app for indecisive, inexperienced drinkers, that would give the user a drink a single drink suggestion they might enjoy based on a quiz/questionaire. 

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108088961/212788010-8f5c1203-0f44-4a89-8c22-fdbc55da88a9.png)

## App Features

## Final Reflections

This solo project solidified my understanding of React, Router, Cypress testing, Global State context, and hooks. The project allowed me to gain more experience using React's functional components and see how the global state impacts routes. I enjoyed the Cypress testing process and felt comfortable intercepting/stubbing my tests for efficiency and error handling. 

Possible extensions for this app include:
1. Create a details page for each cocktail for people to be able to see the specific ingredients in each drink after clicking a drink's thumbnail.
2. Create more questions in the quiz to better guess a user's drink (i.e., more ingredients, able to select multiple ingredients, age, etc.)
3. Create a favoriting/save feature for users to be able to see drinks they have tried and enjoy or want to try
4. Create a more specific search feature for users to be able to filter by ingredients in adition to the current filter choices.
