<!-- PROJECT PLANNING AND USER STORIES -->
## Project Planning and User Stories

Using Excalidraw and AdobeXD, I created a wireframe and data archatecture plan. The MVP was to create an app for indecisive, inexperienced drinkers, that would give the user a drink a single drink suggestion they might enjoy based on a quiz/questionaire.
